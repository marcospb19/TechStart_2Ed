"""
This is the routes module, it contains one FastAPI.APIRouter for each model:
    Category
    Marketplace
    Product
    Seller


Examples:
    user.py contains APIRouter(prefix='user')
    seller.py contains APIRouter(prefix='seller')

So at the main.py, each Router is attached to the main app.
